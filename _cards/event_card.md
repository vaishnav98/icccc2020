The annual conference of the [International Society for Music Information Retrieval](http://ismir.net/) (ISMIR) is the world’s leading research forum on processing, searching, organizing and accessing music-related data.

The ISMIR Conference provides a meeting place for the discussion of MIR-related research. Its main goal is to foster the exchange of ideas across disciplines by bringing together researchers, developers, educators, librarians, students, and professional users.

ISMIR is a non-profit organization which, among other things, oversees the organization of the ISMIR Conference.
